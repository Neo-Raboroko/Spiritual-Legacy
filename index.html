                <h2>Your Spiritual Inheritance</h2>
                
                <div class="letter-content">
                    <p class="greeting">To my kids,</p>
                    
                    <p>The year is 2025, and this website is created for you‚Äîyour spiritual legacy in realtime. This is a blueprint of how your mom navigated her spiritual life at the age of 22.</p>

                    <p>It would be easier to wait ten years (or more) to tell you how I did it, but why not have it written in real time, with real emotions, capturing everything I am facing during this 22nd year? This is the core of who I am‚Äîand Mommy won't always be there when you're navigating your own 22nd year. But God will be, and so will your parent's experience. This channel will be waiting for you.</p>

                    <div class="scripture-highlight">
                        <p>Mommy is guided by <strong>Proverbs 1:7</strong>‚Äî"The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge." And she expects the same, and more, from you.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>Mommy has not met Daddy yet (hahaha üòÑ), but let's set the foundation for your 22nd year now.</p>

                    <div class="year-theme">
                        <h3>My 22nd Year Theme</h3>
                        <blockquote>
                            "But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things will be added to you."
                            <cite>Matthew 6:33</cite>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>My focus is on seeking the Kingdom‚Äîthe heart of God more than the hand of God.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>I don't yet know what the theme of your 22nd year will be, but here is how your mommy did it.</p>

                    <p>This channel will be filled with devotions and interpretations from my daily reading. I am simply on God's errands, and while this is a legacy for my future kids, I am sure some of my friends will appreciate the interpretations.</p>

                    <div class="spiritual-warning">
                        <h4>‚ö†Ô∏è A Spiritual Caution</h4>
                        <p>I am a firm believer in not being "too spiritually accessible"‚Äîdefiling yourself by taking and implementing things based on human opinions, motives, and agenda over God's. I am well aware that I am prone to such. However, through Christ who gives me strength, through Christ who began the good work within me, He will continue His work in me until it is finally finished on the day when Christ Jesus returns.</p>
                        
                        <p class="emphasis">Therefore, I urge you to prayerfully absorb the messages I put out here for you. Seek Christ and read the Bible for yourself, to receive the wisdom that He wants you to receive.</p>
