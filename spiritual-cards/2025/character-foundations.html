                        <h3>Mommy's Reflection:</h3>
                        <p>My dear children, this truth has become the bedrock of my spiritual journey. I'm learning that God isn't primarily looking for talented people, but for trustworthy people. Character is the foundation upon which every lasting work of God is built.</p>
                        
                        <p>Just like Daniel, who was found to be "faithful, with no error or fault," our character qualifies us for God's assignments. The world chases after skills and talents, but God looks at the heart. He can teach anyone skills, but He chooses to work through those whose character reflects His own.</p>

                        <p>Remember this when you're tempted to prioritize achievement over integrity. The most "successful" ministry or career built on compromised character will eventually crumble. But even the smallest act of faithfulness, done with pure character, becomes eternal in God's eyes.</p>

                            <li>Choose integrity even when no one is watching</li>
                            <li>Remember that character is built in small, daily choices</li>
                            <li>Trust that God will use your faithfulness in His timing</li>
