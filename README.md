📞 For Future Generations
To My Children:
If you're reading this years from now, know that every word was written with love and prayer. This isn't a perfect guide—it's a real journey of a young mother learning to walk with God. May it encourage you in your own walk with Christ.

Important Reminder:
"I urge you to prayerfully absorb the messages I put out here for you. Seek Christ and read the Bible for yourself, to receive the wisdom that He wants you to receive."

📜 License
