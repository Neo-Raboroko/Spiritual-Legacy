            <div class="letter-content">
                <p class="greeting">To my kids,</p>

                <p>Daniel 2 opens with the King having a dream. It seems he does not remember nor understand it. But this was no accident. <strong>God ensured that the dream troubled him so much that the only person who would understand it is a vessel.</strong></p>

                <p>Remember that a vessel is a container or conduit for holding or transporting something. In this case, that vessel was Daniel.</p>

                <p>Soon after, we are met with the King placing a decree to execute all the wise men of Babylon. The men the King had consulted were not vessels for the message from God, and it cost them everything.</p>

                <div class="emphasis">
                    <p><strong>Imagine</strong> how many people‚Äîthese "wise" men‚Äîheard about this decree, and how it shook them before it got to Daniel. <strong>Imagine how Daniel must have felt when the news arrived to him.</strong></p>
                    
                    <p>The Bible does not go into detail regarding his feelings, but <strong>I imagine him being unshaken because of the confidence he had in the call, the mission he was on, and knowing that he did not come this far to come this far.</strong></p>
                </div>

                <p>I raise you the <strong>favour</strong> that Daniel received in this place. The guard gave him a chance, which means he disregarded what the King instructed him to do just to hear Daniel out.</p>

                <p>We see Daniel praying. And then, we see the most important part: <strong>soon after receiving the revelation, he immediately praised the God of heaven.</strong></p>

                <div class="scripture-highlight">
                    <p><strong>I hereby advise you:</strong> Go back to the same position you held when you were pleading with the Lord when you get what you asked for. No matter the magnitude of the blessing, no matter the excitement, rather show God your excitement and accompany it with praise and gratitude. <strong>Do not forget to thank God when you get what you prayed for.</strong></p>
                </div>

                <p>Thereafter, we see Daniel taking the revelation to the king. We see him <strong>CLARIFYING</strong> and making it clear: this revelation was made possible by God, it is from God, and that Nebuchadnezzar is a king because of God. <strong>He gave all the glory to God.</strong></p>

                <p>What we see from Daniel is this: <strong>"Those who live in close fellowship with Christ will be promoted by Him to positions of trust."</strong></p>

                <p><strong>The servant who does the best he can for his master, is admitted to familiar intercourse with one whose commands he loves to obey.</strong></p>

                <p>From this I can say: <strong>The relationship and how much you value and regard Christ in your life will be seen in how you tend to your earthly masters.</strong></p>

                <div class="emphasis">
                    <p>The history of Daniel, if all was written, would open chapters before you that would show you the temptations he had to meet‚Äîof ridicule, envy, and hatred. But <strong>he learned to master the difficulties.</strong></p>

                    <p><strong>He did not trust in his own strength; he laid his whole soul and all his difficulties open to his heavenly Father, and he believed God heard him, and he was comforted and blessed.</strong></p>

                    <p><strong>He rose superior to ridicule; and so will every one who is an overcomer.</strong></p>
                </div>

                <p>Daniel acquired a serene and cheerful state of mind because he believed God was his friend and helper. The taxing duties he had to perform were made light because <strong>he brought the light and love of God into his work.</strong></p>

                <p><strong>"All the paths of the Lord are mercy and truth" to such as walk in them.</strong></p>

                <div class="scripture-highlight">
                    <p><strong>Make Christ your friend.</strong> He is the way, the truth, and the light. Without Him you are unable to carry the things of this world, at least in a manner that pleases Him. <strong>Without him you carry burdens that are not even meant for you to carry.</strong></p>

                    <p>Look at Daniel. <strong>He rose superior because He knew how God felt about Him. That was the only voice that mattered to him. Nothing could shake him.</strong></p>
                </div>

                <p>God promises to give us a peace that surpasses all understanding (Philippians 4:7), and this is seen in how Daniel navigated and handled everything that was thrown his way. <strong>Nothing less is expected from you and I.</strong></p>

                <p><strong>Oh what manner of love!</strong></p>

                <p>God gave us His word, the Bible, as the blueprint for life.</p>

                <div class="emphasis">
                    <p>Growing up, I used to complain about how there is no manual for this life. How there are so many rules and you don't know what exactly to do. Guess what? <strong>I was lying! The blueprint is right in front of me.</strong> It is pink (I currently have a pink bible) and I am so, so blessed to have the weight of not knowing how to go about life lifted from me.</p>
                </div>

                <p>There is a song that says, <em>"Oh what peace we often forfeit; oh, what needless pain we bear‚Äîall because we do not carry everything to God in prayer!"</em></p>

                <p><strong>Imagine life without prayer and God? What a stressful life. Oh what manner of life.</strong></p>

                <p><strong>Do not do life without prayer, no matter how sinful you feel.</strong></p>

                <p><strong>Christ crawled to the cross so we can actually fly in this life.</strong> Look to the cross daily. <strong>Pray three times a day like Daniel, if not twelve times.</strong></p>

                <p>The image revealed to the King represented the deterioration of the kingdoms on earth in its power and glory. It also represented the deterioration of religion and morality among the people of these kingdoms.</p>

                <div class="scripture-highlight">
                    <p><strong>"Babylon passed away because in her prosperity she forgot God, and ascribed the glory of her prosperity to human achievement."</strong></p>

                    <p><strong>Do not ever, ever take the credit for what God is doing. You do not want to experience the wrath of God. Never ever make that mistake, my children.</strong></p>
                </div>

                <p>Nebuchadnezzar saw clearly the difference between the wisdom of God and the wisdom of the most learned men of his kingdom.</p>

                <p><strong>Based off of this alone, take a moment and imagine what God can do through you.</strong></p>

                <p><strong>God created the heavens and the earth through WISDOM. The same wisdom is accessible to us. Imagine what you can do.</strong></p>

                <p><strong>Through the Hebrew captives the Lord was made known to the heathen in Babylon.</strong></p>

                <p><strong>Be careful how you live. You are the only Bible some people will ever get to read.</strong></p>

                <p>They were against God, but He still loved them and made provision for their repentance. <strong>Oh what manner of love!!</strong></p>

                <div class="emphasis">
                    <p><em>"Thus the Lord designs that spiritual light shall shine from His faithful watchmen in these last days. If the saints in the Old Testament bore such a decided testimony of loyalty, how should God's people today, having the accumulated light of centuries, shine forth..."</em></p>

                    <p><strong>Be the light of the world.</strong></p>
                </div>

                <div class="final-call">
                    <p><strong>Accept Christ as your Lord and Saviour. Search the scriptures. Find God for yourself and go on His errands.</strong></p>
                    
                    <p><strong>I expect nothing less from you guys.</strong></p>
                </div>
